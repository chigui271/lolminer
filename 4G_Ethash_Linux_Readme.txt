lolMiner 1.18 

How to mine Ethash with your 4G cards.

There are two parameters that have an influence on your 4G mining speed using
the so called Zombie Mode with your 4G card.

Parameter 1: --4g-alloc-size 
This parameter can either be given one value that applied for all GPUs in your
system or it can be a comma seperated list of values. Note that all cards that
are equipped with more then 4G memory will ignore this parameter. A value of 0
is just the lolMiner default. When providing a list of card individual values
do not skip those cards that have more then 4G of memory (just set them to 0).

The higher this parameter is choosen the more memory for a partial dag lolMiner
is allowed to use. Thus the speed on your 4G cards will increase significantly.
Given a recent driver (e.g. amdgpu-pro 20.30 or 20.40) and the right Linux 
kernel (best is 5.4 at the moment), you can almost always set a value of 4078,
on many rigs even 4080. Older drivers or other Linux kernels may require sig-
nificantly lower values and will perform slower.

Usually values that work fine, should also be good on higher epochs, so this 
is a one time tuning effort. 


Parameter 2: --zombie-tune
This parameter will allow the miner to use additional system resources to speed
up the zombie mode on high epochs. Generally setting a value of 2 works best  
for most systems that have connected their GPUs via PCIe gen2 x1 risers. The
tune requires some extra communication of the host with the GPUs and so may
struggle on a gen1 link connection. 

Per default lolMiner will run a auto tune to find the ideal configuration of
your rig. This will totally take approximately 2 minutes per GPU in the system.
At the end the miner will output the result of the automatic tuning so it can
be replicated in future runs. Note that a new epoch may need to re-run the 
tuning for perfect results.

As for the --4g-alloc-size all cards that are equipped with more then 4G 
memory will ignore this parameter. When providing a list of card individual 
values do not skip those cards that have more then 4G of memory (just set 
them to 0). 

The tune can be deactivated by setting it to 0. Note that each card may need an 
individual tuning, so it is best to enable it card by card. Values that are set 
too high will reduce the speed measurably. Use 0 in case the rig shows uncommon
instabilities with the tune enabled.
